Welcome to the Blessed Forge, a curated set of Addons for WarHammer: Return of Reckoning!
</center>
<p>
This site exists purely to gather and help manage the remaining shards
of WAR and RoR addons that can be found floating in the limitless sea
of the Internet on sites active, inactive, and completely defunct.
<p>
Found code, however, is not best preserved like a corpse in the bodybag
of an archive file, but is better served as source, in a version control
repository, where it may be better exposed to pokings and proddings and
even possibly upgrades and updates.  To this end, all addons have been placed
into their own separate repositories, giving them each a home of sorts to
grow into, and facilities such as an issue tracker and wiki, to help them grow.
Where addons already have a home (though I haven't yet found one), that 
home will be shared instead of duplicated.
<p>
Contributions (via pull requests or issues usually) are welcome, nay, encouraged!  Forge on!
